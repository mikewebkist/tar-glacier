tar-glacier

Using old-school Unix tools to create incremental tar backups in Glacier.

Simple usage:

tar-glacier [-L <0|1>]        # Backup level
            [-p <prefix> ]    # Backup prefix -- defaults to hostname
	    [-s <s3 bucket> ] # S3 Bucket to store metadata -- defaults to s3://tar-glacier
	    [pathname ...]    # Paths to be archived

Example:

The simplest form is:
# tar-glacier ~/

This will archive your home directory using s3://tar-glacier to store metadata. The actual tar archives will be stored in a Glacier Vault named "tar-glacier-`hostname`-`date +%Y%m`". The first time you run the command it will back up everything (a "level 0" backup.) For the rest of the month, additional executions will back up only changes since the initial backup ("level 1" backups.)

Note: all backups are either level 0 or level 1, meaning restoring a snapshot only requires the initial level 0 backup and a single level 1 backup. Intermediate level 1 backups are not needed.

TODO:

* Encrypt backups (Public Key with GPG).
* Compress backups (probably not worth it at Glacier prices).
* Resumable backups (stop backup and restart, error recovery, etc.)
* Lots of error checking.
* Restore from backup. (!!!)
